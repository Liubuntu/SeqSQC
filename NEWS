CHANGE IN VERSION 0.99.7
----------------------------

o Added checking for input in subsetGDS.
o Removed commented code for subsetGDS.
o SeqSQCclass renamed as SeqSQC.
o mergeGDS.R. using lapply for some repeated functions like "read.gdsn(index.gdsn())". In SexCheck, Inbreeding, IBDCheck, PCACheck.  
o sampleQC: 1. check the class of vfile for SeqSQC file or vcf/plink file, instead of using vfile / sfile. 
o plotting function writing separately (not export), wrapper with plotQC().   
o Removed IBDRemoveAll.R. Will check IBD for all sample pairs (including benchmark samples) by adding argument "all" in "IBDRemove.R". 
o debugged warning messages from "LoadVfile" and using "rbokeh". 

CHANGE IN VERSION 0.99.6
----------------------------
o modified SeqSQCclass to SeqSQC (not in vignette..).

CHANGE IN VERSION 0.99.5
----------------------------
o Installed BiocGenerics locally.

CHANGE IN VERSION 0.99.4
----------------------------

Load benchmark data from ExperimentHub
o added in the R script, will download only once with first time running of the LoadVfile() or sampleQC().

Bioconductor submission check: 
o Added unit test.
o Added a NEWS file to keep track of changes
o Added zzz.R to fix the no visible binding for global functions or variables. 
o Added the "example_sub.vcf" for 1000 lines of variants to run as example in the package vignette.
o Added accessor methods for SeqSQCclass data structure to get the slots of "gdsfile" and "QCresult".

Vignettes: 
o Added bioconductor installation and library load section in the vignette. 
o Added runnable example vcf file added in "inst/extdata/example_sub.vcf", with 1000 lines of variants. 

MAN: 
o added package documentation for dataset, class, methods and constructor.
